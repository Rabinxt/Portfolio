                        12th Grade (NIST):
                        Following the successful completion of my 10th grade, I continued my educational journey by enrolling at NIST for my 12th grade. This phase of my education provided me with invaluable opportunities to further explore my academic interests and expand my knowledge in various fields. Under the guidance of experienced educators and mentors, I delved deeper into subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, further refining my critical thinking abilities and analytical skills. My experience at NIST not only broadened my intellectual horizons but also fostered personal growth, preparing me for the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead in my academic and professional endeavors.
